# PMY - Title IX Consent Documentation App

## Overview
PMY is a mobile-first web application designed to document consent in compliance with Title IX regulations. It offers multiple methods for consent capture, including digital signatures, audio recordings, photo/selfie capture, and biometric authentication. The application also provides educational resources on Title IX consent, tailored to specific universities. PMY aims to be a secure, legally compliant platform, adhering to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and legal-tech best practices, with the goal of becoming a leading solution for Title IX compliance and education within academic institutions.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application adheres to Apple Human Interface Guidelines, featuring a mobile-first, fully responsive layout with light and dark mode support. It uses a system font stack, a clear heading hierarchy, and Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens for styling. Core UI components include a bottom navigation bar, card-based layouts, inline confirmations, and iOS-standard toast notifications. The primary action, consent creation, is immediately accessible from the homepage, emphasizing a consent-first approach. Color usage follows a semantic color system (e.g., `--destructive`, `--success`, `--primary`) to ensure consistent visual language, automatic dark mode support, and centralized maintenance. Responsive design adapts across all Apple devices with specific breakpoints for iPhone, iPad Mini/Air, and iPad Pro.

### Technical Implementations
The frontend is built with React 18 and TypeScript, utilizing Vite, Wouter for routing, and TanStack Query for server state management. UI components are derived from shadcn/ui (Radix UI) and styled with Tailwind CSS. Form validation is handled by `react-hook-form` and `zod`. The backend uses Express.js with Node.js and TypeScript, providing RESTful API endpoints and handling file uploads via Multer. Drizzle ORM facilitates type-safe PostgreSQL interactions with Neon serverless. Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth with PKCE flow, managing user sessions and providing JWT tokens for secure API access. A `user_profiles` table stores additional user-specific data.

### Feature Specifications
- **Consent Documentation**: Supports digital signature, audio recording, photo/selfie capture, and biometric authentication. The flow dynamically adjusts based on encounter type, featuring a three-state intimate acts selection and optional contract duration with quick presets, manual inputs, and an iOS-style circular graphical picker.
- **Title IX Information**: Provides university-specific educational content and policy summaries generated by OpenAI GPT-4o-mini.
- **Tools**: Quick access panel for Title IX policies, ID verification, and consent documentation status checks.
- **Integrations Settings**: Manages third-party ID and age verification services.
- **User Management**: Secure authentication, account management including email changes, data retention policies, and account deletion.
- **Billing & Payment Methods**: Manages PCI-compliant payment methods via Stripe Payment Methods API, supporting multiple methods and secure collection.
- **University Data**: A database pre-seeded with US universities and their Title IX information.
- **Paid Verification**: Allows users to pay for advanced AI models (GPT-4, GPT-4o) to verify university Title IX policies.
- **Sharing & Referrals**: Features a Dropbox-style referral program using Resend API and allows sharing of consent documents via email, including an Instagram-inspired QR code sharing screen.
- **Instagram-Style Profile**: Displays user avatar, name, stats (total/active contracts, recordings), bio, and website URL, with tab navigation for contracts and recordings.
- **User Preferences**: Allows setting default values for consent flows (university, state, encounter type, duration) to improve efficiency.
- **Async Collaborative Contracts**: Enables co-creation of consent documentation through invitation-based sharing and mutual approval workflows with robust storage and validation. The consent flow includes "Save as Draft" and "Share" buttons at the method selection step, allowing users to save form data (encounterType, parties, intimateActs, contractText, method selection) or invite partners for collaborative approval. Method-specific artifacts (signatures, photos, audio, biometric credentials) are captured AFTER approval when users proceed to method-specific pages. The Contracts page displays three tabs: Active (finalized contracts with artifacts), Drafts (non-collaborative drafts with "Resume Editing" button), and Inbox (collaborative invitations with accept/approve/reject actions). Draft lifecycle enforces isCollaborative gating: collaborative drafts cannot be edited via PATCH (preventing 404 errors), ensuring approval workflow integrity.

### System Design Choices
- **Database Schema**: Includes tables for `universities`, `consentRecordings`, `consentContracts`, `user_profiles`, `payment_methods`, `contract_collaborators`, and `contract_invitations`. The `consentContracts` table includes collaboration fields (`status`, `isCollaborative`, `lastEditedBy`, `intimateActs`, `updatedAt`) with status values: `draft`, `pending_approval`, `active`, `paused`, `completed`, `rejected`. Active contracts automatically transition to `completed` when contractEndTime passes. The `contract_collaborators` table tracks all participants with approval status. The `contract_invitations` table manages email-based sharing with invitation codes and expiration.
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs support CRUD operations and multipart form data.
- **State Management**: Frontend uses TanStack Query for server state and React Context API with a cross-platform storage abstraction for consent flow state. ConsentFlowState includes form data (encounterType, parties, intimateActs, times, method) plus method-specific artifacts (signature1/2, photoUrl, credential fields) for complete draft fidelity during resume editing. Draft hydration restores all fields including isCollaborative flag to gate save/share mutations.
- **iOS-Ready Secure Storage**: Implements AES-256 encrypted Keychain storage on iOS (and Keystore on Android) with fallback to `sessionStorage` for secure data handling.
- **Navigation**: A bottom navigation bar with "Create", "Tools", "Contracts", and "Profile" tabs. The Contracts tab displays Active Contracts (contracts still within their agreed duration period), Paused Contracts (temporarily paused contracts that can be resumed), and Completed Contracts (contracts that have fully transpired their duration) in separate sections. When collaborative contracts feature is enabled, it also includes sub-navigation tabs: Drafts (pending approval) and Inbox (received invitations).
- **Contract Lifecycle & Modification**: Active contracts can be paused by users for temporary suspension while retaining all legal protections. Paused contracts can be resumed to return to active status. Completed contracts (past their contractEndTime) are immutable and cannot be modified, ensuring legal accountability and preventing retroactive changes. This lifecycle management keeps everyone safe and legally protected.
- **Security**: Comprehensive measures include `requireAuth` middleware for sensitive endpoints, user data isolation, ownership verification, Supabase Auth password hashing, server-side validation, WebAuthn, encrypted native storage, and rate limiting.
- **Testing**: A comprehensive automated test strategy covers critical security, core functionality, integration, and polish, utilizing Playwright for E2E tests and specific strategies for Supabase Auth in test environments.
- **Feature Flags**: The application includes a feature flag system (`client/src/lib/featureFlags.ts`) to control experimental and beta features. Feature flags are configured via environment variables prefixed with `VITE_ENABLE_`. Currently supports:
  - `VITE_ENABLE_COLLABORATIVE_CONTRACTS`: Controls the visibility of collaborative contracts features (Save/Share buttons in consent flow, Drafts/Inbox tabs in Files page). When disabled (default), users can only create finalized contracts directly. When enabled, users can save drafts, share for approval, and collaborate asynchronously. This feature is currently in beta and may not be published in production on day one.
